## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Automax, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by creating a **new issue using the "Security Vulnerability" template**.

**Important:** When reporting security issues:
- Do not include sensitive details, proof-of-concept code, or exploit details in the public issue
- Provide a general description without revealing the full technical details
- We will work with you privately to understand and fix the issue
- Allow time for investigation before public disclosure

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up with a comment on the issue.

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and will send you regular updates about our progress. If you have contributed to the fix, we will credit you in the release notes.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patches for the supported versions. Please ensure you are using a supported version of Automax to receive security updates.

## Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help us improve our security. Contributors who report valid security vulnerabilities will be credited in our security advisories and release notes.
